<h1>My Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>Movies that I particularly enjoyed in one way or another</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Mr. Holmes</h3>
<p>An interesting and moving depiction of an aging Sherlock Holmes coming to terms with events that caused
    him to go into retirement, as well as his relationship with his housemaid and her son.
</p>

<h3>Memento</h3>
<p>At the time of its release, the structure of the story telling in this movie was quite novel, making it an
    interesting watch.</p>

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>A wonderful anim√© about a little girl trying to save her parents.</p>
